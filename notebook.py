# <p>An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the company survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years.</p>
# <p>BusinessFinancing.co.uk <a href="https://businessfinancing.co.uk/the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country">researched</a> the oldest company that is still in business in (almost) every country and compiled the results into a dataset. In this project, you'll explore that dataset to see what they found.</p>

# <p>Wow! That's a lot of variation between countries. In one country, the oldest business was only founded in 1999. By contrast, the oldest business in the world was founded back in 578. That's pretty incredible that a business has survived for more than a millennium.</p>

# ## 4. Exploring the categories
# <p>Now we know that the oldest, continuously operating company in the world is called Kongō Gumi. But was does that company do? The category codes in the <code>businesses</code> table aren't very helpful: the descriptions of the categories are stored in the <code>categories</code> table.</p>
# <p>This is a common problem: for data storage, it's better to keep different types of data in different tables, but for analysis, you want all the data in one place. To solve this, you'll have to join the two tables together.</p>

# ## 5. Counting the categories
# <p>With that extra detail about the oldest businesses, we can see that Kongō Gumi is a construction company. In that list of six businesses, we also see a café, a winery, and a bar. The two companies recorded as "Manufacturing and Production" are both mints. That is, they produce currency.</p>
# <p>I'm curious as to what other industries constitute the oldest companies around the world, and which industries are most common.</p>

# ## 6. Oldest business by continent
# <p>It looks like "Banking &amp; Finance" is the most popular category. Maybe that's where you should aim if you want to start a thousand-year business.</p>
# <p>One thing we haven't looked at yet is where in the world these really old businesses are. To answer these questions, we'll need to join the <code>businesses</code> table to the <code>countries</code> table. Let's start by asking how old the oldest business is on each continent.</p>

# ## 7. Joining everything for further analysis
# <p>Interesting. There's a jump in time from the older businesses in Asia and Europe to the 16th Century oldest businesses in North and South America, then to the 18th and 19th Century oldest businesses in Africa and Oceania. </p>
# <p>As mentioned earlier, when analyzing data it's often really helpful to have all the tables you want access to joined together into a single set of results that can be analyzed further. Here, that means we need to join all three tables.</p>
