# <p>Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-gaming-market">Mordor Intelligence</a>. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?</p>
# <p>In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.</p>
# <p>Our database contains two tables. We've limited each table to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata">Kaggle</a>. </p>

# <p>Let's begin by looking at some of the top selling video games of all time!</p>

# In[2]:



get_ipython().run_cell_magic('sql', '', 'postgresql:///games\n    \n-- Select all information for the top ten best-selling games\n-- Order the results from best-selling game down to tenth best-selling\nSELECT *\n    FROM game_sales\n    ORDER BY games_sold DESC\n    LIMIT 10;')


# In[3]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('nose', '', 'from decimal import Decimal as D\nlast_output = _\n\ndef test_output_type():\n    assert str(type(last_output)) == "<class \'sql.run.ResultSet\'>", \\\n    "Please ensure an SQL ResultSet is the output of the code cell." \n\nresults = last_output.DataFrame()\n\ndef test_results():\n    assert results.shape == (10, 6), \\\n    "The results should have six columns and ten rows."\n    assert results.columns.tolist() == ["game", "platform", "publisher", "developer", "games_sold", "year"], \\\n    \'The results should have columns named "game", "platform", "publisher", "developer", "games_sold", and "year".\'\n    assert _.DataFrame().loc[0, \'games_sold\'] == D(\'82.90\')\n    "The top selling game should be Wii Sports with 82.90 million copies sold."')


# ## 2. Missing review scores
# <p>Wow, the best-selling video games were released between 1985 to 2017! That's quite a range; we'll have to use data from the <code>reviews</code> table to gain more insight on the best years for video games. </p>
# <p>First, it's important to explore the limitations of our database. One big shortcoming is that there is not any <code>reviews</code> data for some of the games on the <code>game_sales</code> table. </p>

# In[4]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('sql', '', '\n-- Join games_sales and reviews\n-- Count the number of games where both critic_score and user_score are null\nSELECT COUNT(g.game)\nFROM game_sales g\nLEFT JOIN reviews r\nON g.game = r.game\nWHERE critic_score IS NULL AND user_score IS NULL;')


# In[5]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('nose', '', 'last_output = _\n\ndef test_output_type():\n    assert str(type(last_output)) == "<class \'sql.run.ResultSet\'>", \\\n    "Please ensure an SQL ResultSet is the output of the code cell." \n\nresults = last_output.DataFrame()\n\ndef test_results():\n    assert results.shape == (1, 1), \\\n    "The query should return just one value, a count of games where both critic_score and user_score are null."\n    assert results.columns.tolist() == ["count"], \\\n    \'The results should have just one column, called "count".\'\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'count\'] == 31, \\\n    "There should be 31 games where both critic_score and user_score are null."')


# ## 3. Years that video game critics loved
# <p>It looks like a little less than ten percent of the games on the <code>game_sales</code> table don't have any reviews data. That's a small enough percentage that we can continue our exploration, but the missing reviews data is a good thing to keep in mind as we move on to evaluating results from more sophisticated queries. </p>
# <p>There are lots of ways to measure the best years for video games! Let's start with what the critics think. </p>

# In[6]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('sql', '', '\n-- Select release year and average critic score for each year, rounded and aliased\n-- Join the game_sales and reviews tables\n-- Group by release year\n-- Order the data from highest to lowest avg_critic_score and limit to 10 results\nSELECT g.year, ROUND(AVG(r.critic_score),2) AS avg_critic_score\nFROM game_sales g\nINNER JOIN reviews r\nON g.game = r.game\nGROUP BY g.year\nORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC\nLIMIT 10;')


# In[7]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('nose', '', 'from decimal import Decimal as D\nlast_output = _\n\ndef test_output_type():\n    assert str(type(last_output)) == "<class \'sql.run.ResultSet\'>", \\\n    "Please ensure an SQL ResultSet is the output of the code cell." \n\nresults = last_output.DataFrame()\n\ndef test_results():\n    assert results.shape == (10, 2), \\\n    "Make sure to limit the query to only ten results."\n    assert results.columns.tolist() == ["year", "avg_critic_score"], \\\n    \'The results should have two columns, called "year" and "avg_critic_score".\'\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'year\'] == 1990, \\\n    "The year with the highest score should be 1990."\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'avg_critic_score\'] == D(\'9.80\'), \\\n    "The highest average critic score should be 9.80."')


# ## 4. Was 1982 really that great?
# <p>The range of great years according to critic reviews goes from 1982 until 2020: we are no closer to finding the golden age of video games! </p>
# <p>Hang on, though. Some of those <code>avg_critic_score</code> values look like suspiciously round numbers for averages. The value for 1982 looks especially fishy. Maybe there weren't a lot of video games in our dataset that were released in certain years. </p>
# <p>Let's update our query and find out whether 1982 really was such a great year for video games.</p>

# In[8]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('sql', '', '\n-- Paste your query from the previous task; update it to add a count of games released in each year called num_games\n-- Update the query so that it only returns years that have more than four reviewed games\nSELECT g.year, COUNT(g.game) AS num_games, ROUND(AVG(r.critic_score),2) AS avg_critic_score\nFROM game_sales g\nINNER JOIN reviews r\nON g.game = r.game\nGROUP BY g.year\nHAVING COUNT(g.game) > 4\nORDER BY avg_critic_score DESC\nLIMIT 10;')


# In[9]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('nose', '', 'from decimal import Decimal as D\nlast_output = _\n\ndef test_output_type():\n    assert str(type(last_output)) == "<class \'sql.run.ResultSet\'>", \\\n    "Please ensure an SQL ResultSet is the output of the code cell." \n\nresults = last_output.DataFrame()\n\ndef test_results():\n    assert results.shape == (10, 3), \\\n    "Make sure to limit the query to only ten results."\n    assert set(last_output.DataFrame().columns) == set(["year", "num_games", "avg_critic_score"]), \\\n    \'The results should have three columns: "year", "num_games", and "avg_critic_score".\'\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'year\'] == 1998, \\\n    "The year with the highest score should be 1998."\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'num_games\'] == 10, \\\n    "In the year with the highest critic score, there were 10 games released."\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'avg_critic_score\'] == D(\'9.32\'), \\\n    "The highest average critic score should be 9.32."')


# ## 5. Years that dropped off the critics' favorites list
# <p>That looks better! The <code>num_games</code> column convinces us that our new list of the critics' top games reflects years that had quite a few well-reviewed games rather than just one or two hits. But which years dropped off the list due to having four or fewer reviewed games? Let's identify them so that someday we can track down more game reviews for those years and determine whether they might rightfully be considered as excellent years for video game releases!</p>
# <p>It's time to brush off your set theory skills. To get started, we've created tables with the results of our previous two queries:</p>

# ## 6. Years video game players loved
# <p>Based on our work in the task above, it looks like the early 1990s might merit consideration as the golden age of video games based on <code>critic_score</code> alone, but we'd need to gather more games and reviews data to do further analysis. </p>
# <p>Let's move on to looking at the opinions of another important group of people: players! To begin, let's create a query very similar to the one we used in Task Four, except this one will look at <code>user_score</code> averages by year rather than <code>critic_score</code> averages.</p>

# In[13]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('nose', '', 'last_output = _\n\ndef test_output_type():\n    assert str(type(last_output)) == "<class \'sql.run.ResultSet\'>", \\\n    "Please ensure an SQL ResultSet is the output of the code cell." \n\nresults = last_output.DataFrame()\n\ndef test_results():\n    assert results.shape == (10, 3), \\\n    "Don\'t forget to limit the query results to ten."\n    assert set(results.columns.tolist()) == set(["year", "num_games", "avg_user_score"]), \\\n    \'The results should have three columns: "year", "num_games", and "avg_user_score".\'\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'year\'] == 1997, \\\n    "The year with the highest user score should be 1997."\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'num_games\'] == 8, \\\n    "In the year with the highest user score, there were eight games released."\n    assert last_output.DataFrame().loc[0, \'avg_user_score\'] == 9.50, \\\n    "The highest average user score should be 9.50."')


# ## 7. Years that both players and critics loved
# <p>Alright, we've got a list of the top ten years according to both critic reviews and user reviews. Are there any years that showed up on both tables? If so, those years would certainly be excellent ones!</p>
# <p>Recall that we have access to the <code>top_critic_years_more_than_four_games</code> table, which stores the results of our top critic years query from Task 4:</p>

# ## 8. Sales in the best video game years
# <p>Looks like we've got three years that both users and critics agreed were in the top ten!
