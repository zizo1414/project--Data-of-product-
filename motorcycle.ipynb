PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide equivalent).\n\nThis data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, `prouduct_emissions`, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred.
